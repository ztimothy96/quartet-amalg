hi hello @ tim

each of the folders in this file have dist, quart, and seq-id files 
for sequences generated from INDELible 


sequences come from the following tree (TREE-A): 

((((A,B),(C,D)),((E,F),(G,H))),(((I,J),(K,L)),((M,N),(O,P))));
       
  [branchlengths] EQUAL // All branch lengths will be equal
  [treedepth] 0.1       // Root-to-longest-tip distance of 0.1

the number at the end of the folder name indicates the length of the sequences

you can find the files generated from INDELible in quartet-files/from-sim-A/
