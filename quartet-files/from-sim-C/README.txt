each of the folders in this file have dist, quart, and seq-id files 
for sequences generated from INDELible 


sequences come from the following tree (TREE-C): 

TREE-C
  (((((((1,(2,3,4),5,6),7),(8,9)),10),(11,(12,13))),((((14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21),(22,23,24)),(((25,26),(27,28)),29,30)),31)),32);

   [branchlengths] EQUAL // All branch lengths will be equal
  [treedepth] 1.5       // Root-to-longest-tip distance of 1.5

there are 32 species

(got this tree from https://www.treebase.org/treebase-web/search/study/taxa.html?id=10939&treeid=25358))

the number at the end of the folder name indicates the length of the sequences

you can find the files generated from INDELible in quartet-files/from-sim-C/
